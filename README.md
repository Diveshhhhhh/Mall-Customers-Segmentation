# Objective
The objective of this project is to segment customers of a mall based on their demographic characteristics and spending patterns. This segmentation will help the mall management understand different customer groups, allowing for tailored marketing strategies, personalized customer experiences, and optimized product offerings. The use case is to identify distinct clusters of customers who share similar traits, which can be leveraged to improve customer satisfaction and drive sales growth.
